# Trivia Game Website Instructions üöÄ<!-- AN: "Website" Instructions? Consider just using "Trivia Game" or "Trivia Game Web Application"? -->

Welcome to the Trivia Game website! Follow these instructions to start playing

<!-- AN: Steps? What steps? -->
<!-- AF: changed from "steps" to instructions -->
<!-- AN: These still aren't really instructions.. just aspects of the web app. Instructions would be more like: (1) Navigate to <ip address:port>. You will see a log in screen. (2) Click register. (3) Register an account. (4) Log in. (5) Click Play Random or set parameters and click Play Quiz... something like this, though I don't think its necessary. -->

# Creating an Account

_An account is needed to play the game_

<!-- AN: Do you need an account to play? -->
<!-- AF: added in the note "an account is needed to play the game" -->
<!-- AN: Big Heading 1 for a single sentence. -->

<!-- J: the heading sizes are a bit confusing. maybe make creating an account the main title and make log in the same size as registration. Or put login below registration-->
<!-- AF: made it an h1 tag instead of an h2 -->
<!-- AN: The order and organization here is illogical. You can't log in without having registered. Logging in is also not part of creating an account. -->

## Log In

**Log In**: If you have previously created an account, you can log in using your login credentials.

- Tick the "Remember me" checkbox to avoid needing to login each time you access the website!
  <!-- AN: Logging in should be its own section. -->
  <!-- AF: yessir ü´° -->

- Password
  - Passwords need at least **one uppercase letter**, **lowercase letter**, **one special character**, and need to be at least **eight** characters long.

<!-- AF: added a line saying users need to click on the "Don't have an acc..." button -->

## Home Page

After logging in, you'll be directed to the home page. Here, you'll see three lists: <!-- AN: drop-down/dropdown list/menu, not "drop down" -->
<!-- AN: You say three but have a 5-item list. These are also not lists. They are buttons and dropdown menus. -->
